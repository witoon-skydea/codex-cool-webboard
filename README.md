# codex-cool-webboard

This is a simple pastel-colored web board example. The front end works entirely in the browser and stores posts in `localStorage`. A tiny Node.js server is provided to serve the static files.

## How to run

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
2. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

3. Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the board.
